- Research the following:
    - Is it valid to expect `%h`, `%v`, and `%V` to always be hostnames (or an
      IP address, for `%h`)?  Failing that, can they at least be expected to
      not contain whitespace?
    - Check whether `%a` can be a comma-separated list of IP addresses (in case
      of proxying/X-Forwarded-For and the like)

- Test every directive

- For each directive that doesn't match what one would na√Øvely expect, add a
  comment explaining why (including what versions of Apache the behavior is
  observed in)

- Include instructions in the documentation for adding your own format
  directives (including `%{*}t` sub-directives)

- Add a console script entry point: `apachelogs2json [--format <format>]
  [<file> ...]`
    - The special names "combined" and "common" (et alii?) are accepted as
      formats.
    - Default format: combined?  Guess at combined or common?
